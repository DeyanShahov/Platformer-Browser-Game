## Brief overview
This project-specific rule applies to the RPG browser game development, focusing on adapting proven RPG mechanics from systems like Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder instead of inventing new systems from scratch.

## RPG mechanics adaptation principles
- Use proven models for leveling, progression, combat, and inventory systems
- Adapt d20 + modifier mechanics for probability checks and outcomes
- Prioritize modularity and data-driven configurations for scalability

## Core engine structure
- Implement a modular RPG core engine in Vanilla JS for shared mechanics
- Separate core logic from UI/DOM rendering for maintainability
- Define XP tables, combat calculations, and inventory slots as configurable data

## Assistant behavior guidelines
- Propose adaptations of established RPG systems rather than creating novel mechanics
- Ensure suggested code is easily integrable and balances arcade-style play with depth
- Use JSON configurations for easy tuning of game balance and expansion

## Design approach
- Employ d20 rolls with modifiers for randomness and skill checks
- Maintain clear separation between core mechanics and presentation layers
- Support data-driven item effects and character progression
